        <h2>In our ART129 class, we are given the chance to be able to build our own brand and I have decided to do a blind box design. I was inspired by the sudden popularity of blind boxes and wanted to do my own. Each bear features street-style fashion and nerdy influences like sports, comic, and pop culture, blending playful character design with a bold, contemporary aesthetic.
        </h2>
        <h2>I started off with researching for a logo-type for the brand. I took inpiration from grafitti lettering and used Procreate to create my own version of grafitti. However with much experimentation, I decided to stick with a bold and serious font to balance out the chaos of the box design itself.</h2>
        <h2>Creating an original appearance for the characters was quite a challenge since the brands figurines needs to have a memorable feature that sets them apart from other collectible toys. The initial sketches started off with just the main idea of a bear character and started to build from there to iterate their own personalities and identities through certain trends and influences.With several attempts and endless researching, I have made the eyes a distinct part about them in their own style and expression since the 'BOO' in Booyah Bears resemble a pair of eyes. </h2>
        <h2>In the package design, I wanted it to evoke a sense of fun and optimism and so I related sparks, fun patterns, and unusual color combinations to associate with the brand which would be applied to later merchandise products such as bags as well as advertising using billboards.</h2>

                        Looking for a suitable logo for the brand that i am doing was quite a hefty research since there are so many typefaces to choose from. I opted to try doing a handdrawn sketch to imitate grafitti however I didn't follow through with the idea and chose to do a more cut and serious logo using 'Futura'.</h2>
