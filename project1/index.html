            <h1>THE CHALLENGES</h1>
            <h2>The challenges that came through with this project is the overall image of the logo. Most would 
                say the design comes off rather grotesque and disturbing looking. To briefly explain their current 
                logo, it includes the Earth that is being washed over a bucket of red paint; in which in a more 
                explicit sense looks a lot like blood covering the globe. </h2>

                        <h2>Upon researching the company's brand and history, I delved into some pretty interesting aspects that 
                            used to be apart of the company's identity such as a chameleon in a medallion being their first symbol. The 
                            very first Sherwin Williams logo dated back in 1885 which was designed by one of the founders, Henry Sherwins,
                            opted for a chameleon that looks to be on a painter's pallette.</h2>

            which is what we know as the "Cover the Earth" approach.</h2>
