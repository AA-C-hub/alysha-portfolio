          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>Hello, I'm Alysha!</h2>
          <p>Some things to learn about me is that I am from the Philippines; born but not entirely raised. I grew up in many places that I've once considered home and that is also including here in Honolulu, Hawaii. I moved here when I was 15 years old and been living here since.</p>
          <p>I have always loved creating art as a kid as well as consuming it whether it be listening to music or simply sketch on a notebook about my favorite cartoons. This passion of mine grew along with me as it extended towards the realm of graphic designing. </p>
          <p>In high school, I took design electives and joined the design academy, where hands-on projects sparked my passion for design. My most memorable experience was creating and screen printing our own T-shirts. Now, I’m continuing to pursue that passion through the New Media Arts program at Kapi‘olani Community College.</p>
          <p>I am naturally a very curious person so I gravitate towards the "Why's" and "How's" of pretty much everything. With curiosity, comes with learning which then hones into experience and if it goes well, a skill.</p>
          <p><strong>I always yearn to learn!</strong></p>
