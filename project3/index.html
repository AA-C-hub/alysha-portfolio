      <h1>TOURISM LOGO</h1>
      <h2>For my ART125 class, we were tasked with creating or recreating a logo for a city we wanted to represent. I chose Helsinki, Finland as my city of focus because of its unique blend of modernity and nature, as well as its rich cultural heritage.</h2>
      </h2>
      <h2>The project began with extensive research into Finland’s culture in order to understand the essence of the city. I initially explored Finnish folklore, myths, and superstitions as potential sources of inspiration for the logo. However, I discovered that Finland is deeply influenced by modernism, expressed in a way that maintains strong style and authenticity rooted in its early design influences. Through this research, I learned about Helsinki’s architectural styles which were particularly its Art Nouveau influences that ultimately played a significant role in shaping my design approach.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        While sketching, I took much inspiration with the arched windows commonly found in Helsinki’s Art Nouveau buildings. These windows often feature organic, flowing shapes that mimic natural forms, which I found to be a beautiful representation of the city’s connection to nature. I incorporated these shapes into my logo design, aiming to capture the elegance and uniqueness of Helsinki’s architectural heritage. 
      </h2>
      <h2>I chose to use a window as the central element of the logo because it symbolizes connection, perspective, and openness. A window functions as a boundary between interior and exterior spaces, much like how the people of Helsinki experience a close relationship between the built environment and nature. In a city where architecture is designed to coexist harmoniously with natural landscapes, the window becomes a metaphor for viewing, appreciating, and remaining connected to the surrounding environment.</h2>

                          <h3>Helsinki is the capital and largest city of Finland, close to Estonia and Russia. It is a vibrant city known for its clean environment, and unique blend of Nordic 
                            and Eastern European influences.
                          </h3>
                          <h3>
                            Despite being a capital, Helsinki maintains a relaxed, small-city atmosphere, with a strong focus on sustainability, smart city development, and nature.
                            Helsinki combines history, innovation, and natural beauty, making it one of the most livable and forward-thinking cities in Europe.
                          </h3>
